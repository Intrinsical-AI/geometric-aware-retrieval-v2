## Research Contributions

This software implements and validates:

1. **Differentiable Soft-kNN with Degree Correction (Ï„-fix)**: A novel method for 
   constructing differentiable k-nearest neighbor graphs with exact degree control.

2. **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating 8.7x speedup 
   over traditional methods while maintaining perfect degree control.

3. **Geometric-Aware Information Retrieval**: End-to-end differentiable pipeline for 
   learning geometric representations in embedding spaces.
